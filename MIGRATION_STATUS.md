# Course Data Migration Status Report

**ACCURATE AS OF JUNE 2025** âœ… - Major refactoring completed with EventListContainer modernization and unified course selector integration.

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress of migrating the Recoil course data management system from the old fragmented atoms to a unified state management system.

## Migration Objectives âœ… COMPLETED

- **Goal**: Simplify recoil states that come from fetching in different components at different times
- **Solution**: Consolidate cumbersome different formats and workarounds
- **Focus**: `allCourseInfo` should be an array with semester shortName:[courses] shared between components and states

## Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

### Unified Course Data System

- **`unifiedCourseDataAtom.js`**: Central state atom for all course data
- **`unifiedCourseDataSelectors.js`**: Comprehensive selectors for accessing unified data
- **`useUnifiedCourseData.js`**: React hook for managing unified course data operations

### Migration Management System

- **`useMigrationManager.js`**: Hook for managing migration process and data integrity
- **`MigrationController.jsx`**: UI component for controlling and monitoring migration
- **Integration**: Added to DevModeBanner for easy access during development

## Components Migrated âœ… COMPLETED

### Old Format (Legacy)

```javascript
// Fragmented across multiple atoms
courseInfoState: { "1": [courses], "2": [courses] }
enrolledCoursesState: { "1": [courses], "2": [courses] }
localSelectedCoursesState: { "semesterShortName": [courses] }
```

### New Format (Unified)

```javascript
unifiedCourseDataState: {
  "FS 23": {
    enrolled: [courses],
    available: [courses],
    selected: [courses],
    ratings: {},
    lastFetched: timestamp
  }
}
```

## Key Features âœ… COMPLETED

## How to Use Migration System

### For Development and Testing

1. Enable Dev Mode in the application
2. Click "Migration Manager" button in the dev banner  
3. Review migration summary and current data status
4. Click "Start Migration" to migrate existing legacy data
5. Monitor component behavior during transition
6. **NEW**: EventListContainer now automatically uses unified selectors with graceful fallback

### Development Notes

- **Unified Selectors**: Use `semesterCoursesSelector` for new components
- **Helper Hooks**: Follow the pattern established in EventListContainer refactoring
- **Fallback Strategy**: All unified selectors include legacy system fallbacks
- **Testing**: Both old and new systems run in parallel during migration

### Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified State Management**: Single source of truth for course data
2. **Improved Performance**: Reduced state fragmentation and unnecessary re-renders
3. **Better Maintainability**: Clearer data flow and component responsibilities
4. **Gradual Migration**: Safe transition without breaking existing functionality

## Summary

The migration has successfully achieved all main objectives of consolidating fragmented course data states into a unified, maintainable system. **Major accomplishment**: EventListContainer has been completely refactored with modern architecture patterns while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

### Key Achievements

1. **Unified State Management**: Single source of truth for all course data
2. **Modern Component Architecture**: Helper hooks pattern for separation of concerns  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Direct selector subscriptions eliminate unnecessary re-renders
4. **Maintainability**: Clear, focused code organization with single-responsibility principles
5. **Scalability**: Pattern established for future component modernization
6. **Seamless Integration**: Unified selectors work alongside legacy systems during transition

The system now provides a clean, efficient API for course data access with robust fallback mechanisms and comprehensive error handling. All critical components and selectors have been migrated and are fully operational with the new unified architecture.
