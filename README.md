## 🔌 Kill Switch (degraded mode)

During a demand spike (e.g. intro week), SHSG-backed features (wishlist,
ratings, curriculum map, smart search, custom grades) can be disabled
client-side via a one-file config toggle, without a backend deploy — course
browsing, calendar, and transcript stay up. See
[`docs/KILLSWITCH.md`](docs/KILLSWITCH.md) for how to enable/disable it
during an incident.
